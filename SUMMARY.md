# SUMMARY - Implementation Log

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Complete CS 330 final project - 3D desk workspace scene recreation in C++ and OpenGL.

**Reference Image:** `desk_scene.png` - Modern workspace with coffee mug, tech accessories on oak desk.

**Current Status:** Coffee mug (complex object with 5 primitives) and table surface completed. Adding 3 additional objects and enhanced lighting to meet final requirements.

## [2025-10-17] Planning: Scene Object Expansion & Lighting Enhancement

**Change Type:** Feature Planning
**Scope:** SceneManager

**Summary:**
Planned implementation of 3 additional scene objects (blue sphere, keyboard, touchpad) and enhanced 5-light system to create realistic indoor workspace illumination.

**Rationale:**

*Objects Selection:*
- **Blue Sphere:** Adds vibrant color contrast to neutral palette. Simple primitive demonstrates basic geometric rendering. Positioned front-left for compositional balance.
- **Keyboard:** Central workspace element using low-poly box primitive. Prominent in reference image and immediately recognizable. Demonstrates rectangular scaling techniques.
- **Touchpad/Tablet:** Completes tech workspace theme. Very thin box primitive showcases precise scale control. Positioned right side to balance composition.

All objects use simple primitives (sphere, box) to maintain low-polygon requirement (<1000 triangles per object).

*Lighting Enhancement:*
Current 4-light setup simulates outdoor sunlight entering workspace but lacks typical indoor ambient illumination. Real workspaces have ceiling fixtures providing overhead fill light. Adding 5th directional light pointing straight down simulates indoor room lighting for more realistic environment.

Additionally, existing fill lights (Lights 1-3) need brightness adjustment to better approximate realistic light bounce in an indoor setting. Natural environments have significant ambient reflection from walls, ceilings, and surfaces that our current values underrepresent.

*Texture Approach:*
- Blue sphere: Solid blue material (demonstrates non-textured rendering path)
- Keyboard: Dark gray/black texture or solid material (tech surface appearance)
- Touchpad: Reuse keyboard material for consistency or add slate gray texture

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pen holder (cone): Deferred to optional - adds geometric variety but less prominent than keyboard
- Smart speaker (cylinder): Deferred to optional - similar to pen holder priority
- Monitor with stand: Too complex for remaining scope - requires multiple primitives and positioning

**Implementation Strategy:**
Incremental feature branches following GitFlow:
1. `feature/add-blue-sphere`
2. `feature/add-keyboard`
3. `feature/add-touchpad`
4. `feature/enhance-lighting`
5. `refactor/code-quality`

Each branch implements one object or enhancement, builds successfully, and merges to main before next branch.

### [2025-10-17] Feature: Blue Rubber Stress Ball Object

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** SceneManager
**Branch:** `feature/add-blue-sphere`

**Summary:**
Implemented blue rubber stress ball object using sphere primitive mesh. Object positioned at front-left desk location (-3.5, 0.8, 3.5) with rubber coating texture and material properties configured for realistic matte rubber appearance.

**Implementation Details:**

*Mesh & Geometry:*
- Loaded sphere primitive mesh via `m_basicMeshes->LoadSphereMesh()` in `PrepareScene()`
- Applied uniform scale of 0.8 (effective radius 0.8 units)
- Positioned with Y = 0.8 to sit tangent on table surface at Y = 0.0
- Maintains low-polygon requirement (<1000 triangles)

*Texture & Materials:*
- Loaded `rubber-coating.jpg` texture with tag "rubber"
- Defined rubber material with properties:
  - Ambient: (0.15, 0.20, 0.35) with strength 0.35 for subtle blue base
  - Diffuse: (0.30, 0.40, 0.70) for vibrant blue surface color
  - Specular: (0.05, 0.05, 0.08) - low reflectivity for matte rubber
  - Shininess: 6.0 - minimal highlight focus appropriate for rubber coating
- UV scale: 1.0 × 1.0 (full texture mapping)

*Code Organization:*
- Created `RenderBlueSphere()` method in SceneManager.cpp
- Added function declaration to SceneManager.h
- Integrated render call into `RenderScene()` pipeline
- Follows established pattern from coffee mug rendering methods

**Rationale:**
Stress ball serves as simple single-primitive object to meet minimum 4-object requirement. Blue color provides strong visual contrast against neutral oak desk and earthy mug tones. Front-left positioning balances composition and matches reference image layout. Rubber material properties (low specular, low shininess) create realistic matte appearance distinct from ceramic mug and wood table.

**Technical Challenges:**
- Initial Y positioning error: Incorrectly calculated effective radius as 0.4 instead of 0.8 (scale × default radius 1.0), causing sphere to sink partially into table. Fixed by positioning center at Y = 0.8 for proper tangent placement.
- Terminology correction: Updated all references from "decorative sphere" to "stress ball" to accurately reflect object purpose and material composition.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Solid color material (no texture): Rejected in favor of textured approach to demonstrate texture mapping technique and add visual interest.
- Different positioning: Front-left chosen for compositional balance and prominence in scene.
