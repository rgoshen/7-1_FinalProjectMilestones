## [2025-10-17] Planning: Scene Object Expansion & Lighting Enhancement

**Change Type:** Feature Planning
**Scope:** SceneManager

**Summary:**
Planned implementation of 3 additional scene objects (blue sphere, keyboard, touchpad) and enhanced 5-light system to create realistic indoor workspace illumination.

**Rationale:**

*Objects Selection:*
- **Blue Sphere:** Adds vibrant color contrast to neutral palette. Simple primitive demonstrates basic geometric rendering. Positioned front-left for compositional balance.
- **Keyboard:** Central workspace element using low-poly box primitive. Prominent in reference image and immediately recognizable. Demonstrates rectangular scaling techniques.
- **Touchpad/Tablet:** Completes tech workspace theme. Very thin box primitive showcases precise scale control. Positioned right side to balance composition.

All objects use simple primitives (sphere, box) to maintain low-polygon requirement (<1000 triangles per object).

*Lighting Enhancement:*
Current 4-light setup simulates outdoor sunlight entering workspace but lacks typical indoor ambient illumination. Real workspaces have ceiling fixtures providing overhead fill light. Adding 5th directional light pointing straight down simulates indoor room lighting for more realistic environment.

Additionally, existing fill lights (Lights 1-3) need brightness adjustment to better approximate realistic light bounce in an indoor setting. Natural environments have significant ambient reflection from walls, ceilings, and surfaces that our current values underrepresent.

*Texture Approach:*
- Blue sphere: Solid blue material (demonstrates non-textured rendering path)
- Keyboard: Dark gray/black texture or solid material (tech surface appearance)
- Touchpad: Reuse keyboard material for consistency or add slate gray texture

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pen holder (cone): Deferred to optional - adds geometric variety but less prominent than keyboard
- Smart speaker (cylinder): Deferred to optional - similar to pen holder priority
- Monitor with stand: Too complex for remaining scope - requires multiple primitives and positioning

**Implementation Strategy:**
Incremental feature branches following GitFlow:
1. `feature/add-blue-sphere`
2. `feature/add-keyboard`
3. `feature/add-touchpad`
4. `feature/enhance-lighting`
5. `refactor/code-quality`

Each branch implements one object or enhancement, builds successfully, and merges to main before next branch.

## Implementation Log

### [2025-10-17] Feature: Blue Rubber Stress Ball Object

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** SceneManager
**Branch:** `feature/add-blue-sphere`

**Summary:**
Implemented blue rubber stress ball object using sphere primitive mesh. Object positioned at front-left desk location (-3.5, 0.8, 3.5) with rubber coating texture and material properties configured for realistic matte rubber appearance.

**Implementation Details:**

*Mesh & Geometry:*
- Loaded sphere primitive mesh via `m_basicMeshes->LoadSphereMesh()` in `PrepareScene()`
- Applied uniform scale of 0.8 (effective radius 0.8 units)
- Positioned with Y = 0.8 to sit tangent on table surface at Y = 0.0
- Maintains low-polygon requirement (<1000 triangles)

*Texture & Materials:*
- Loaded `rubber-coating.jpg` texture with tag "rubber"
- Defined rubber material with properties:
  - Ambient: (0.15, 0.20, 0.35) with strength 0.35 for subtle blue base
  - Diffuse: (0.30, 0.40, 0.70) for vibrant blue surface color
  - Specular: (0.05, 0.05, 0.08) - low reflectivity for matte rubber
  - Shininess: 6.0 - minimal highlight focus appropriate for rubber coating
- UV scale: 1.0 × 1.0 (full texture mapping)

*Code Organization:*
- Created `RenderBlueSphere()` method in SceneManager.cpp
- Added function declaration to SceneManager.h
- Integrated render call into `RenderScene()` pipeline
- Follows established pattern from coffee mug rendering methods

**Rationale:**
Stress ball serves as simple single-primitive object to meet minimum 4-object requirement. Blue color provides strong visual contrast against neutral oak desk and earthy mug tones. Front-left positioning balances composition and matches reference image layout. Rubber material properties (low specular, low shininess) create realistic matte appearance distinct from ceramic mug and wood table.

**Technical Challenges:**
- Initial Y positioning error: Incorrectly calculated effective radius as 0.4 instead of 0.8 (scale × default radius 1.0), causing sphere to sink partially into table. Fixed by positioning center at Y = 0.8 for proper tangent placement.
- Terminology correction: Updated all references from "decorative sphere" to "stress ball" to accurately reflect object purpose and material composition.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Solid color material (no texture): Rejected in favor of textured approach to demonstrate texture mapping technique and add visual interest.
- Different positioning: Front-left chosen for compositional balance and prominence in scene.

### [2025-10-17] Planning: Keyboard Object Implementation Strategy

**Change Type:** Feature Planning
**Scope:** SceneManager - Phase 2
**Branch:** `feature/add-keyboard` (pending creation)

**Summary:**
Designed two-layer keyboard approach using dual box primitives to balance visual realism with low-polygon requirement. Bottom layer represents plastic housing/frame using lighting-based matte black material. Top layer displays individual keys via keyboard.jpg texture.

**Implementation Strategy:**

*Two-Layer Design:*
- **Layer 1 - Keyboard Body/Frame:**
  - Single box primitive (plastic housing)
  - Solid black color (no texture)
  - Material properties: diffuse (0.08, 0.08, 0.08), specular (0.1, 0.1, 0.1), shininess 10-12
  - Phong lighting system creates matte plastic appearance naturally
  - Scale: ~4.5w × 0.1h × 1.5d
  - Provides border/frame effect around key surface

- **Layer 2 - Key Surface:**
  - Single box primitive (raised keys)
  - keyboard.jpg texture showing individual key layout
  - Slightly smaller than base to expose frame edges
  - Y-offset ~0.05-0.08 above base for raised appearance
  - Scale: ~4.3w × 0.05h × 1.4d

**Rationale:**

*Why Two Layers vs Single Box:*
Real keyboards have distinct visual separation between plastic housing and key surface. Two-layer approach adds depth and realism while maintaining extremely low polygon count (2 box primitives << 1000 triangle limit). Single-layer approach would flatten appearance and lose dimensional quality visible in reference image.

*Why Lighting-Based Material for Frame:*
Using Phong lighting calculations to create matte black plastic appearance rather than texture provides:
- Realistic response to scene lighting (sunlight, fill lights)
- Natural specular highlights appropriate for plastic material
- No texture memory overhead for simple solid color
- Demonstrates both textured and non-textured rendering paths (project requirement)

*Why Keyboard Texture for Keys:*
Individual 3D key geometry (~60-100 separate boxes) would violate low-polygon requirement and contradict "simple approximation" project scope. Texture-based key representation provides visual detail without geometric complexity. Project explicitly requires "simple approximation using basic shapes" - this approach honors that constraint.

*Positioning Strategy:*
Center-front desk position (~x:0, z:1.5) places keyboard as focal workspace element matching reference image composition. This positioning creates natural user workspace layout with keyboard forward, stress ball left-front, and mug behind.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single flat box with keyboard texture only: Rejected - lacks dimensional depth, appears too simplistic
- Individual 3D key geometry: Rejected - violates polygon budget, contradicts "simple approximation" requirement
- Solid color keys (no texture): Rejected - loses visual interest and key detail present in reference image
- Three-layer design (frame + keys + base): Rejected - unnecessary complexity for minimal visual benefit

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `RenderKeyboard()` method with two sequential box draws
- First draw: base frame with black material
- Second draw: raised key surface with keyboard texture
- Y-positions calculated relative to table surface (Y=0.0)
- Both layers share X/Z center position with Y-offset differentiation

### [2025-10-17] Feature: Keyboard Object Implementation

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** SceneManager
**Branch:** `feature/add-keyboard`

**Summary:**
Implemented two-layer keyboard object using dual box primitives positioned at center-front desk location (0.0, 0.05-0.13, 1.5). Layer 1 renders black plastic housing/frame using lighting-based matte material. Layer 2 displays keyboard.jpg texture showing individual key layout, raised above base to create dimensional depth.

**Implementation Details:**

*Two-Layer Architecture:*
- **Layer 1 - Keyboard Frame/Housing:**
  - Single box primitive scaled to 4.5w × 0.10h × 1.5d
  - Positioned at Y = 0.05 (sits on table surface at Y = 0.0)
  - Black plastic material with properties:
    - Ambient: (0.02, 0.02, 0.02) with strength 0.15
    - Diffuse: (0.08, 0.08, 0.08) for matte black appearance
    - Specular: (0.10, 0.10, 0.10) for subtle plastic highlights
    - Shininess: 12.0 - moderate highlight focus for plastic
  - Uses solid color rendering (bUseTexture = false) to demonstrate non-textured path
  - Phong lighting creates realistic matte plastic appearance naturally

- **Layer 2 - Textured Key Surface:**
  - Single box primitive scaled to 4.3w × 0.05h × 1.4d (smaller than frame)
  - Positioned at Y = 0.13 (raised 0.08 units above frame)
  - keyboard.jpg texture mapped to surface showing individual keys
  - Keys material properties:
    - Ambient: (0.18, 0.18, 0.18) with strength 0.20
    - Diffuse: (0.45, 0.45, 0.45) for grey key surface
    - Specular: (0.08, 0.08, 0.08) for subtle key highlights
    - Shininess: 10.0 for moderate plastic key appearance
  - UV scale: 1.0 × 1.0 (full texture mapping)
  - Smaller dimensions expose frame edges creating border effect

*Materials Defined:*
1. "plastic" - Matte black plastic for keyboard housing
2. "keys" - Grey plastic for textured key surface layer

*Code Organization:*
- Created `RenderKeyboard()` method in SceneManager.cpp with comprehensive header comment
- Added function declaration to SceneManager.h under "Desk object rendering methods"
- Integrated render call into `RenderScene()` pipeline after `RenderBlueSphere()`
- Loaded keyboard.jpg texture in `LoadSceneTextures()` with tag "keyboard"
- Defined two materials in `DefineObjectMaterials()`: "plastic" and "keys"
- Follows established pattern from coffee mug and stress ball rendering

*Positioning Strategy:*
- Center-front desk position (X:0.0, Z:1.5) creates natural workspace focal point
- Matches reference image composition with keyboard as primary work surface element
- Complements stress ball (front-left) and mug (behind) positioning
- Creates cohesive workspace narrative

**Rationale:**

*Why Two-Layer Design:*
Real keyboards exhibit distinct visual separation between plastic housing perimeter and raised key surface. Two-layer approach adds dimensional depth and realism while maintaining extremely low polygon count (2 box primitives << 1000 triangle limit). Single-layer approach would flatten appearance and lose dimensional quality visible in reference image. Raised key surface creates shadow/edge effects under scene lighting that enhance 3D perception.

*Why Lighting-Based Material for Frame:*
Using Phong lighting calculations to create matte black plastic appearance provides:
- Realistic dynamic response to all scene lighting (sunlight, fill lights)
- Natural specular highlights appropriate for plastic material properties
- Zero texture memory overhead for simple solid color surface
- Demonstrates both textured and non-textured rendering paths (project requirement)
- Leverages existing lighting system for consistent material behavior

*Why Keyboard Texture for Keys:*
Individual 3D key geometry (~60-100 separate boxes) would:
- Violate low-polygon requirement (<1000 triangles per object)
- Contradict "simple approximation using basic shapes" project scope (CLAUDE.md)
- Add unnecessary geometric complexity for marginal visual benefit

Texture-based key representation provides:
- Visual detail of individual key layout without geometric overhead
- Realistic keyboard appearance honoring "simple approximation" constraint
- Efficient rendering performance (single draw call vs. 60+ draw calls)
- Industry-standard approach for low-poly modeling (texture detail vs. geometry)

*Sizing and Proportion Rationale:*
- Width 4.5 units creates prominent desk presence matching reference image
- Depth 1.5 units maintains realistic keyboard proportions (~3:1 ratio)
- Frame height 0.10 provides visible border without excessive bulk
- Key surface height 0.05 creates thin, realistic key profile
- 0.08 unit vertical offset creates visible shadow/separation under lighting

**Technical Challenges:**
- Material state management: Ensured proper bUseTexture toggle between non-textured frame and textured keys
- UV scale reset: Added explicit UV scale reset after non-textured draw to prevent inheritance issues
- Texture state restoration: Restored bUseTexture = true after frame render for subsequent textured objects
- Layer alignment: Calculated precise Y-offset (0.08) to create visible raised effect without gaps

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single flat box with keyboard texture only: Rejected - lacks dimensional depth, appears too simplistic and flat under 3D lighting
- Individual 3D key geometry per key: Rejected - violates polygon budget and contradicts "simple approximation" requirement
- Three-layer design (frame + keys + separate base): Rejected - unnecessary complexity for minimal visual benefit, increases polygon count without proportional realism gain
- Solid color keys (no texture): Rejected - loses visual interest and key detail present in reference image

**Project Requirements Met:**
- Adds 3rd distinct object to scene (table, mug complex, stress ball, keyboard = 4 objects)
- Uses simple primitives (2 box meshes) maintaining low-polygon requirement
- Demonstrates both textured and non-textured rendering techniques
- Proper transformations applied (Scale → Rotate → Translate order)
- Materials defined with comprehensive Phong lighting properties

### [2025-10-17] Refinement: Keyboard Dimensions and Positioning

**Change Type:** Refinement
**Scope:** SceneManager - RenderKeyboard()
**Branch:** `feature/add-keyboard`

**Summary:**
Modified keyboard object to use solid colors instead of keyboard.jpg texture (texture loading caused application crashes). Increased keyboard dimensions for better proportions and repositioned both keyboard and blue sphere to improve scene spacing and composition.

**Implementation Changes:**

*Texture Approach Modified:*
- Removed keyboard.jpg texture loading from `LoadSceneTextures()` (caused crashes)
- Removed "keys" material definition
- Modified `RenderKeyboard()` to use solid colors only:
  - Layer 1 (frame): Black plastic (0.08, 0.08, 0.08)
  - Layer 2 (keys): Dark grey (0.15, 0.15, 0.15)
- Both layers now use "plastic" material with Phong lighting
- Maintains two-layer dimensional design without texture dependency

*Keyboard Dimensions Increased:*
- Frame: 4.5 × 0.10 × 1.5 → **7.0 × 0.10 × 3.0** (56% wider, 100% longer)
- Keys: 4.3 × 0.05 × 1.4 → **6.8 × 0.05 × 2.8** (58% wider, 100% longer)
- Proportions improved to match realistic keyboard appearance
- Maintains thin profile appropriate for modern low-profile keyboard

*Keyboard Position Adjusted:*
- Z position: 1.5 → **4.0** (moved 2.5 units closer to camera)
- Creates proper spacing between keyboard and mug (mug at Z ≈ 0)
- Keyboard now clearly in foreground as primary workspace element
- X and Y positions unchanged (centered on table)

*Blue Sphere Position Adjusted:*
- X position: -3.5 → **-5.5** (moved 2 units left)
- Creates better spacing between keyboard left edge and sphere
- Improves compositional balance and prevents visual crowding
- Z and Y positions unchanged

**Rationale:**

*Why Remove Texture:*
Application crashed consistently when loading keyboard.jpg texture. Investigation revealed Intel graphics driver access violation during texture bind/sample operations. Solid color approach provides stable rendering while maintaining visual distinction between frame and key surface through lighting and color variation. Two-layer design still creates dimensional depth through geometry and shadow effects.

*Why Increase Dimensions:*
Original 4.5 × 1.5 dimensions appeared too small relative to mug and table scale. Keyboard looked more like a smartphone than a full-sized keyboard. Increased dimensions (7.0 × 3.0) create better proportions matching realistic keyboard size while remaining well within low-polygon budget (still only 2 box primitives).

*Why Reposition Keyboard:*
Original Z position (1.5) placed keyboard too close to mug base, creating visual collision/overlap from certain camera angles. Moving to Z = 4.0 establishes clear foreground/background separation: keyboard (foreground) → mug (midground) → table extends to background. This layering enhances depth perception and matches typical desk workspace layout.

*Why Reposition Blue Sphere:*
With enlarged keyboard (7.0 width), original sphere position (-3.5) created tight spacing between keyboard left edge (~-3.5) and sphere center. Moving sphere to X = -5.5 provides 2 units of clear space, preventing visual crowding and improving compositional balance.

**Technical Notes:**
- Color values (0.08 vs 0.15) provide subtle contrast between frame and keys visible under scene lighting
- Both layers use same "plastic" material ensuring consistent Phong lighting behavior
- `bUseTexture` toggled to false for both draws, restored to true after
- UV scale reset maintained for subsequent textured objects

**Visual Result:**
Keyboard appears as appropriately-sized, realistic workspace element with clear dimensional separation between black housing and grey key surface. Proper spacing achieved between all desk objects (sphere left, keyboard center-front, mug center-back). Scene composition balanced and proportional.

### [2025-10-17] Refinement: Three-Section Keyboard Design with Solid Colors

**Change Type:** Refinement
**Scope:** SceneManager - RenderKeyboard()
**Branch:** `feature/add-keyboard`

**Summary:**
Redesigned keyboard to use three-section layout (main keyboard, navigation cluster, numpad) with solid colors instead of textures. This approach creates realistic keyboard appearance through geometric subdivision while avoiding texture-related complications and scope creep.

**Implementation Changes:**

*Three-Section Layout:*
- **Left section (Main keyboard)**: 5.0 × 0.05 × 2.8 at X = -1.8
- **Middle section (Navigation)**: 1.5 × 0.05 × 2.8 at X = 1.75
- **Right section (Numpad)**: 1.5 × 0.05 × 2.8 at X = 3.55
- Equal gaps of 0.3 units between sections expose black frame underneath
- Overall frame: 9.0 × 0.10 × 3.0 (3:1 width:depth ratio)

*Color and Material:*
- Frame: Black plastic (0.08, 0.08, 0.08) - same as before
- Key sections: Lighter grey (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) - increased from 0.15 for better contrast
- All sections use "plastic" material with Phong lighting
- No textures required

*Primitive Count:*
- Total: 4 box primitives (1 frame + 3 key sections)
- Well within low-polygon budget (<1000 triangles)

**Rationale:**

*Why Three Sections vs Single Surface:*
Real keyboards have distinct visual separation between main typing area, navigation cluster (arrows/home/end), and numeric keypad. Three-section design creates this realistic layout while maintaining extremely low polygon count. Visible gaps between sections add authenticity and depth through shadow effects under scene lighting.

*Why Solid Colors vs Texture:*
Multiple texture approaches were attempted but encountered significant issues:
1. **Original keyboard.jpg (7471×3098)**: Caused application crash - unusual dimensions exceeded GPU texture limits or had memory alignment issues
2. **Resized keyboard.jpg (1024×1024)**: Contained large grey padding around actual keyboard image. Attempts to use partial UV mapping resulted in tiling artifacts or incomplete coverage
3. **Custom texture creation**: Would require external image editing work to crop/create properly-sized keyboard texture - deemed **out of scope** for this CS 330 project focused on 3D graphics programming, not texture asset creation

Solid color approach provides:
- **Stable rendering** without crash risks
- **Clean visual appearance** with clear section differentiation
- **Phong lighting interaction** creates realistic plastic surface with highlights and shadows
- **Demonstrates non-textured rendering path** (project requirement to show both textured and non-textured techniques)
- **Focuses on geometric design** rather than texture asset management

*Why Equal Gap Spacing:*
Equidistant gaps (0.3 units) between all sections create visual rhythm and balance. Unequal gaps appeared unintentional/haphazard rather than deliberate design choice.

*Why Keep All Sections in One Function:*
Keyboard sections remain in single `RenderKeyboard()` method rather than separate `RenderKeyboardMain()`, `RenderKeyboardNav()`, etc. because:
- All sections are part of same conceptual object (one keyboard)
- Share identical material, Y position, Z position, and depth
- Only differ in width and X position (spatial subdivision)
- Easier to maintain equal gap spacing with all sections visible together
- Less code duplication

This differs from coffee mug approach where each part (body, handle, interior, coffee) uses different shapes, materials, and transformations, justifying separate render methods.

*Keyboard Dimensions:*
Final 9.0 × 3.0 frame (3:1 ratio) matches realistic keyboard proportions. Main keyboard section (5.0 width) dominates layout as expected, with smaller navigation (1.5) and numpad (1.5) sections as accents. Total width fits well within table bounds while maintaining clear foreground positioning.

**Technical Notes:**
- Left section positioned at X = -1.8 (ends at 0.7)
- Middle section positioned at X = 1.75 (starts at 1.0, ends at 2.5) - 0.3 gap from left
- Right section positioned at X = 3.55 (starts at 2.8) - 0.3 gap from middle
- All sections raised to Y = 0.13 (0.08 above frame at Y = 0.05)
- Frame depth increased from 2.5 to 3.0 to maintain 3:1 width:depth ratio

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Texture-based approach: Rejected due to GPU compatibility issues and scope creep into asset creation
- Single solid surface: Rejected - lacks visual interest and realism of sectioned keyboard
- Four sections (separate arrow cluster): Rejected - added complexity without proportional visual benefit
- Separate render functions per section: Rejected - unnecessary code duplication for spatially-divided single object

**Project Requirements Met:**
- Demonstrates non-textured rendering with Phong lighting (complements textured objects like table, mug, sphere)
- Uses simple primitives (4 boxes) maintaining low-polygon requirement
- Proper transformations applied (Scale → Rotate → Translate order)
- Materials defined with comprehensive Phong properties
- Avoids scope creep into texture asset creation

**Visual Result:**
Keyboard appears as realistic, modern full-size keyboard with distinct main typing area and smaller navigation/numpad sections. Equal black gaps create visual rhythm and depth. Lighter grey (0.25) provides clear contrast against black frame while maintaining cohesive color scheme with scene's neutral palette.

## [2025-10-17] Planning: Touchpad Object Implementation Strategy

**Change Type:** Feature Planning
**Scope:** SceneManager - Phase 3
**Branch:** `feature/add-touchpad` (in progress)

**Summary:**
Designed touchpad object to complement keyboard using similar two-layer solid color approach. Touchpad will be positioned to the right of the keyboard as a smaller, square touch surface.

**Implementation Strategy:**

*Two-Layer Design (Similar to Keyboard):*
- **Layer 1 - Touchpad Frame/Border:**
  - Single box primitive (black plastic frame)
  - Solid black color (0.08, 0.08, 0.08)
  - Provides border around touch surface
  - Slightly larger than active surface layer

- **Layer 2 - Touch Surface:**
  - Single box primitive (flush with frame, not raised)
  - Lighter grey color (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) - matches keyboard key sections
  - Slightly smaller than frame to expose black border around edges
  - Same Y position as frame for flush, flat touchpad appearance

*Sizing and Positioning:*
- **Square proportions** - equal width and depth for touchpad appearance
- **Smaller than keyboard** - approximately 2.5 × 2.5 units
- **Positioned right of keyboard** - creates balanced desk workspace layout
- **Similar depth to keyboard** - maintains visual cohesion in scene

*Primitive Count:*
- Total: 2 box primitives (1 frame + 1 surface)
- Extremely low polygon count, well under budget

**Rationale:**

*Why Two-Layer Design:*
Matches keyboard design language for visual consistency. Real touchpads have distinct border/bezel around active touch surface. Two-layer approach creates this separation while maintaining low polygon count (2 boxes << 1000 triangle limit). Unlike keyboard keys which are raised, touchpad surface is flush with frame for realistic flat touch surface appearance.

*Why Solid Colors:*
- Consistency with keyboard approach (no texture issues)
- Clean, modern appearance matching tech workspace theme
- Demonstrates non-textured rendering with Phong lighting
- Avoids scope creep into texture asset creation
- Lighter grey surface contrasts with black border similar to keyboard

*Why Square Shape:*
Touchpads are typically square or nearly-square unlike rectangular keyboards. Square proportions clearly differentiate touchpad from keyboard while maintaining realistic appearance.

*Why Position Right of Keyboard:*
- Matches typical desk workspace layout (keyboard center, touchpad/mouse right)
- Balances composition (blue sphere left, keyboard center, touchpad right)
- Creates visual variety in object positioning across scene
- Provides clear object separation for meeting minimum 4-object requirement

*Why Reuse Keyboard Material:*
Both keyboard and touchpad use same black plastic material. Reduces material count and creates visual cohesion between related workspace objects.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Textured approach with touchpad image: Rejected - same scope concerns as keyboard texture
- Single flat box: Rejected - lacks dimensional depth and border detail
- Circular touchpad: Rejected - more complex geometry, less typical of modern devices
- Three-layer design (frame + surface + button area): Rejected - unnecessary complexity

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `RenderTouchpad()` method in SceneManager
- Two sequential box draws with different scales and Y positions
- First draw: black frame base
- Second draw: raised grey surface
- Reuse existing "plastic" material
- Position calculated relative to keyboard right edge

**Project Requirements Met:**
- Adds 4th distinct object to scene (table, mug, sphere, keyboard, touchpad = 5 objects)
- Uses simple primitives (2 boxes) maintaining low-polygon requirement
- Demonstrates non-textured rendering technique
- Proper transformations (Scale → Rotate → Translate order)
- Material reuse promotes code efficiency

### [2025-10-17] Feature: Touchpad Object Implementation

**Change Type:** Feature
**Scope:** SceneManager
**Branch:** `feature/add-touchpad`

**Summary:**
Implemented touchpad object using two-layer design with minimally raised surface. Positioned right of keyboard as smaller square touch surface, completing the 5-object requirement for the scene.

**Implementation Details:**

*Two-Layer Architecture:*
- **Layer 1 - Frame/Border:**
  - Box primitive scaled to 2.0 × 0.10 × 2.0 (square)
  - Positioned at Y = 0.05 (sits on table at Y = 0.0)
  - Black plastic material (0.08, 0.08, 0.08)
  - Provides visible border around touch surface

- **Layer 2 - Touch Surface:**
  - Box primitive scaled to 1.8 × 0.05 × 1.8 (smaller square)
  - Positioned at Y = 0.08 (raised 0.03 units above frame)
  - Lighter grey (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) - matches keyboard key sections
  - Thinner height (0.05 vs 0.10) creates subtle raised appearance
  - 0.2 unit border visible on all sides

*Positioning:*
- Center position: X = 6.0, Z = 4.0
- Right of keyboard (keyboard right edge ~4.5, touchpad center 6.0)
- Same depth (Z) as keyboard for visual alignment
- Creates balanced composition: sphere left, keyboard center, touchpad right

*Materials:*
- Reuses existing "plastic" material from keyboard
- No new material definitions required
- Consistent Phong lighting behavior with keyboard

*Code Organization:*
- Created `RenderTouchpad()` method in SceneManager.cpp (lines 964-999)
- Added function declaration to SceneManager.h (line 125)
- Integrated render call into `RenderScene()` (line 659)
- Follows established pattern from keyboard implementation

**Rationale:**

*Why Smaller Size (2.0 × 2.0):*
Touchpads are smaller than keyboards in real workspace setups. 2.0 × 2.0 scale creates realistic proportion relative to 9.0 × 3.0 keyboard while remaining clearly visible and identifiable.

*Why Minimally Raised Surface:*
Initially designed flush, but minimal raise (0.03 units) adds subtle dimensional depth visible under scene lighting. Creates shadow/highlight effects that enhance 3D perception without appearing unrealistic. Thinner surface height (0.05 vs frame 0.10) emphasizes the raised effect.

*Why Square Shape:*
Modern touchpads are typically square or near-square, distinctly different from rectangular keyboards. Square proportions clearly communicate "touchpad" vs "keyboard" to viewer.

*Why Position Right of Keyboard:*
- Matches typical workspace ergonomics (keyboard center, touchpad/mouse right side)
- Balances scene composition with blue sphere on left
- Creates visual interest through varied object positioning
- Provides clear object separation for grading requirement

*Why Reuse Material:*
Both keyboard and touchpad use black plastic frames with grey surfaces - they're related tech objects with similar materials. Material reuse reduces code complexity and creates visual cohesion.

**Technical Notes:**
- Frame: 2.0 × 0.10 × 2.0 at Y = 0.05
- Surface: 1.8 × 0.05 × 1.8 at Y = 0.08 (0.03 raise, 0.2 border)
- Position: X = 6.0, Z = 4.0 (right of keyboard)
- Uses 2 box primitives total
- bUseTexture = false for solid color rendering
- Texture state restored after rendering

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Flush surface (Y = 0.05): Rejected - lacked dimensional depth visible in lighting
- Larger size (2.7 × 2.7): Rejected - appeared too large relative to keyboard
- Rectangular shape: Rejected - would be confused with keyboard, less realistic
- Higher raise (0.08+): Rejected - appeared unrealistic for touchpad design

**Project Requirements Met:**
- Adds 5th object to scene (table, mug, keyboard, sphere, touchpad) - exceeds 4-object minimum
- Uses simple primitives (2 boxes) maintaining low-polygon requirement
- Demonstrates non-textured rendering with Phong lighting
- Proper transformations applied (Scale → Rotate → Translate order)
- Material reuse promotes code efficiency

**Object Count Status:**
1. Table plane (box with tiled texture) ✓
2. Coffee mug (complex: body, interior, coffee, handle, base) ✓
3. Blue stress ball (sphere with texture) ✓
4. Keyboard (frame + 3 key sections = 4 boxes) ✓
5. Touchpad (frame + surface = 2 boxes) ✓

**Total: 5 distinct objects, exceeding minimum requirement of 4**

**Visual Result:**
Touchpad appears as compact square surface right of keyboard with subtle raised grey center and visible black border. Completes balanced workspace composition with objects distributed left (sphere), center (keyboard), and right (touchpad).
